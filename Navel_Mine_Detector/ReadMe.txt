Naval Mine Detector Technology: Deep Learning with Neural network | Python

● Mine detection and classification using side scan sonar imagery is a challenging problem. As opposed to the majority of techniques, several Neural-network-based methods for the detection and classification of mines and mine-like objects have been proposed.
● Detection and classification of underwater objects in sonar imagery is a complicated problem due to various factors such as variations inoperating and environmental conditions, the presence of spatially varying clutter, and variations in target shapes, compositions, and orientation.
● By using the concept of Deep Learning with a Neural network, predicted whether the object is Mine or not
